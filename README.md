=========
A curated list of amazingly awesome parasite information and open-access databases. 


## Databases

 * Olival et al. 2017 [Mammal-virus database](https://zenodo.org/record/807517#.Wv7kuFMvzOQ) 
   with [analysis](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature22975?sf90794030). Ongoing updates are hosted on [github](https://github.com/ecohealthalliance/HP3)
 * [PREDICT](http://data.predict.global/) Field data from the USAID PREDICT project 2008-2019, a global emerging virus surveillance program. This data is downloadable if you have a healthmap account. 
 * [Global Mammal Parasite Database 2.0](https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ecy.1799) a database of the parasites of wild ungulates (artiodactyls and perissodactyls), carnivores, and primates
 * [PEARL](http://pearl.berkeley.edu/) Conservation assessments of macroparasitic invertebrates
 * [Virus-Host DB](http://www.genome.jp/virushostdb/view/) synthesizes host-virus associations from genomes posted in NCBI/RefSeq and GenBank
 * [NHM Host-parasite database](http://www.nhm.ac.uk/research-curation/scientific-resources/taxonomy-systematics/host-parasites/) database of parasitic worms maintained by London Natural History Museum. [Wells et al. 2018](http://nicholasjclark.weebly.com/uploads/4/4/9/4/44946407/wells_etal_2018_globchangbiol.pdf) provides a broad analysis of this database. 
 * [ENHanCEd Infectious Diseases Database (EID2)](https://eid2.liverpool.ac.uk/) Pulls organism associations from NCBI sequences and PubMed
 * [Arbovirus Catalog (ARBOCAT)](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/arbocat/) CDC-curated arbovirus information including dates of first isolation and wildlife hosts
 * [Global Biotic Interactions (GloBI)](https://www.globalbioticinteractions.org/data.html) Species interaction repository that can be searched by 'parasite of', 'pathogen of', or 'host of'.
 * [DBatVir](www.mgc.ac.cn/DBatVir) Bat viruses curated from Genbank with host traits and summaries by location
 * [DRodVir](http://www.mgc.ac.cn/DRodVir/) Rodent viruses curated from Genbank with host traits
 * [PHI-base](http://www.phi-base.org/index.jsp) database with information on specific genes of fungal, Oomycete and bacterial pathogens that affect pathogenicity. Centered on agricultural and medical pathogens of importance. 
 

## Reporting Sytems 
 * [World Animal Health Information System (WAHIS)](http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Diseaseinformation/reportarchive) OIE archive of country alerts and regular reports of certain pathogens. They also have some nice interfaces to show disease distribution and timelines.
 * [Healthmap](https://www.healthmap.org/en/) provides infectious disease outbreak alerts for humans and animals.
 * [Program for Monitoring Emerging Diseases (ProMed)](http://www.promedmail.org/) Early warning of outbreaks of emerging and re-emerging diseases. Sources of information include media reports, official reports, online summaries, local observers, and others.

## Taxonomy
 * [NCBI Taxonomy](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/taxonomy) The Taxonomy Database is a curated classification and nomenclature for all of the organisms in the public sequence databases, both parasites and hosts.
 * [ICTV](https://talk.ictvonline.org/taxonomy/) Viral taxonomy with excellent archives
 * [IUCN Redlist](http://www.iucnredlist.org/) provides taxonomic information for hosts. You can use the R package `rredlist` and [API](http://apiv3.iucnredlist.org/api/v3/docs) to access the data directly. 

## Scientific Journals 
 * [Journal of Wildlife Diseases](http://www.jwildlifedis.org/loi/jwdi) JWD provides many open-access articles on new parasite expansions or discoveries
 * [American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene](http://www.ajtmh.org/) AJTMH publishes a broad range of papers covering topics in tropical medicine. Their archive is open-access after a 12-month embargo
 * [Emerging Infectious Diseases](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/) CDC open-access journal
